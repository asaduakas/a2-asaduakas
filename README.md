Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===

## Calckinator
This is a simple web calculator that takes an operation and computes a result on the server. It also keeps a list of previous operations. You can delete any data row you want by clicking the X button next to the result in the history table. For this small project, I've used the Flexbox as my CSS positioning.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Updated the handlePost method to parse the incoming data, then compute the operation, and finally send the operation and the result back as an object.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: The data is saved inside the appdata on server.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Used the VT323 font trying to achieve a retro terminal vibe.
- **Design Achievement 2**: Used an AI generated color pallete from http://colormind.io
- **Design Achievement 3**: Used flexbox justify-content to align and center objects
- **Design Achievement 4**: Used class,id, and div selectors to control the background, color, size, widths, heights, padidngs, and borders of objects.
