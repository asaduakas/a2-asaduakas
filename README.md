Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===

## Calckinator
This is a simple web calculator that takes an operation and computes a result on the server. It also keeps a list of previous operations. You can delete any data row you want by clicking the X button next to the result in the history table. For this small project, I've used the Flexbox as my CSS positioning.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Updated the handlePost method to parse the incoming data, then compute the operation, and finally send the operation and the result back as an object. Also, implemented the deletion of data through handlePost as well.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: The data is saved inside the appdata on server.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: The data is deleted from the server when the button next to entry is clicked.


### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Used the VT323 font trying to achieve a retro terminal vibe.
- **Design Achievement 2**: Used an AI generated color pallete from http://colormind.io
- **Design Achievement 3**: Used flexbox justify-content to align and center objects
- **Design Achievement 4**: Used class,id, and div selectors to control the background, color, size, widths, heights, padidngs, and borders of objects.
